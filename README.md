# SEARCH-Algorithms

**Ternary Search Algorithm in C++**

**Description : **

This project implements the Ternary Search algorithm in C++, which divides the array into three parts and recursively searches for a key. Ternary search is faster than binary search for certain cases and operates on sorted arrays.

**Features : **

- Efficient search for sorted arrays.
- Time complexity: O(logâ‚ƒn) in the best case.



**Binary Search Algorithm in C++**

**Description : **

This C++ project implements the Binary Search algorithm to efficiently search for a key in a sorted array. Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the middle element with the target key.

**Features : **

- Efficient searching in a sorted array.
- Time complexity: O(log n).
